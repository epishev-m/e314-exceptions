# E314.Exceptions

The `E314.Exceptions` module provides enhanced exception classes that improve standard error handling mechanisms in .NET. These exceptions include additional data such as a unique error code (`ErrorCode`), extra data (`ErrorData`), the file name, method name, and line number where the exception occurred. This makes debugging and logging more informative.
